# Topic:

  Our team HashtagSocialMedia decided to see if social media usage affected our mental health. We asked ourselves several questions to determine this. The first question we asked ourselves is if activity varies throughout the week and if so, what impact it had on certain emotions. The reason we asked this question is to see if perhaps our mood differed during the work week vs the weekend or if our mood was better in the evening as opposed to early morning. We also had limited data on passive and active use of social media, and we decided to take advantage of this to see if perhaps there was a difference between our mental health and passive social media use vs active social media use and mental health. We also wanted to compare the frequency of the notifications and see if perhaps it caused stress or depression. The goal of having this information was to see if it was the type of content that was causing a negative mental health impact vs using social media as an outlet for our emotions. We also considered outside factors such as the type of news exposed and lunar phases.

## Activity during the Week

By refering to the file Weekday vs Activity we can see that Wednesday has the highest activity compared to any other day, which raised another question. We decided to see if perhaps there was a correlation between Activity and Fatigue, and that term "Happy Hump Day" had more context. We also compared that information to other emotions. Since statistically there was no significant results, we decided to look into other areas.

## Saturation of notifications

We created a dataframe for a select group of participants to determine the average minutes between notifications for date:05/22/2017 and found that those individuals with a higher amount of notifications had scored a bit higher for fatigue and concentration and not necessarily depression. As a result other questions were also raised from this information, such as the impact of traumatic news on individuals.

## The Manchester Bombing on 5/22/2017

Scatter plots were created to determine if mental health factors varied across 05/22/2017 vs other days. Statistically there was no difference, it is difficult to determine if the individuals in this study were exposed to the news or if they were unaffected by it. It is however worth noting that Stress and Concentration levels were higher on this date. We believe that if we had a bigger sample set we may have gotten better statistical information.

## Passive social media usage and its impact emotions

Comparing the information we had found in regards to active social media use to passive social media use, we found that passive social media use does in fact show to cause feelings of inferiority and hopelessness. Nonetheless without knowing what exactly was being viewed in each participants news feed it is difficult to determine if the individual already had these emotions or if what was viewed caused these emotions.

## Social media interactions and Phases of the Moonâ€™s

To cover as many aspects as possible we also investigated the phases of the moon to mental health. Our statistical analysis of this found that during the New Moon to First Quarter there is a higher degree of fatigue, loneliness, depression, inferiority, hopelessness and stress in comparision to other phases of the moon.

To conclude we neither can prove or disprove our hypothesis, there were several survey questions we wished would have been asked in this dataset. The data also only consisted of 125 participants and was conducted over 3 months. If we had more data over a larger timeframe perhaps we could have made a better determination.
